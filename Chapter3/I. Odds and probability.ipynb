    "By odds, we mean for example 3:1 (three to one), which means that we expect that for every three cases of an outcome, for example winning a bet, there is one case of the opposite outcome, not winning the bet. The other way to express the same would be to say that the chances of winning are 3/4 (three in four). \n",
    "\n",
    "Three out of four is of course the same as 75% (mathematicians prefer to use fractions like 0.75 instead of percentages). It has been found that people get confused and make mistakes more easily when dealing with fractions and percentages than with natural frequencies or odds. This is why we use natural frequencies and odds whenever convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "But **be very careful!** The odds 1:5 (one win for every five losses), even if it can be expressed as the decimal number 0.2, is different from 20% probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds 1:5 mean that you'd have to play the game **six times** to get one win on the average. The probability 20% means that you'd have to play **five times** to get one win on the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "For odds that are greater than one, such as 5:1, it is easy to remember that we are not dealing with probabilities because no probability can be greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if the odds in favor of an event are x:y, the probability of the event is given by x / (x+y)."
