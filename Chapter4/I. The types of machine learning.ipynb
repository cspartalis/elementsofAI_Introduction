Now you probably know something that an average machine learning expert doesn’t!"

    "**Supervised learning**: We are given an input, for example a photograph with a traffic sign, and the task is to predict the correct output or label, for example which traffic sign is in the picture (speed limit, stop sign, etc.). In the simplest cases, the answers are in the form of yes/no (we call these binary classification problems).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning**: There are no labels or correct outputs. The task is to discover the structure of the data: for example, grouping similar items to form “clusters”, or reducing the data to a small number of important “dimensions”. Data visualization can also be considered unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",

    "As a concrete example, grocery store chains collect data about their customers' shopping behavior (that's why you have all those loyalty cards). To better understand their customers, the store can either visualize the data using a graph where each customer is represented by a dot and customers who tend to buy the same products are placed nearer each other than customers who buy different products. Or, the store could apply clustering to obtain a set of customer groups such as ‘low-budget health food enthusiasts’, ‘high-end fish lovers’, ‘soda and pizza 6 days a week’, and so on. Note that the machine learning method would only group the customers into clusters, but it wouldn't automatically generate the cluster labels (‘fish lovers’ and so on). This task would be left for the user."
